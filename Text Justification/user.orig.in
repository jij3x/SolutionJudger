264 1 Fourscore 1 and 1 seven 1 years 1 ago 1 our 1 fathers 1 brought 1 forth 1 on 1 this 1 continent 1 a 1 new 1 nation, 1 conceived 1 in 1 liberty 1 and 1 dedicated 1 to 1 the 1 proposition 1 that 1 all 1 men 1 are 1 created 1 equal. 1 Now 1 we 1 are 1 engaged 1 in 1 a 1 great 1 civil 1 war, 1 testing 1 whether 1 that 1 nation 1 or 1 any 1 nation 1 so 1 conceived 1 and 1 so 1 dedicated 1 can 1 long 1 endure. 1 We 1 are 1 met 1 on 1 a 1 great 1 battlefield 1 of 1 that 1 war. 1 We 1 have 1 come 1 to 1 dedicate 1 a 1 portion 1 of 1 that 1 field 1 as 1 a 1 final 1 resting-place 1 for 1 those 1 who 1 here 1 gave 1 their 1 lives 1 that 1 that 1 nation 1 might 1 live. 1 It 1 is 1 altogether 1 fitting 1 and 1 proper 1 that 1 we 1 should 1 do 1 this. 1 But 1 in 1 a 1 larger 1 sense, 1 we 1 cannot 1 dedicate, 1 we 1 cannot 1 consecrate, 1 we 1 cannot 1 hallow 1 this 1 ground. 1 The 1 brave 1 men, 1 living 1 and 1 dead 1 who 1 struggled 1 here 1 have 1 consecrated 1 it 1 far 1 above 1 our 1 poor 1 power 1 to 1 add 1 or 1 detract. 1 The 1 world 1 will 1 little 1 note 1 nor 1 long 1 remember 1 what 1 we 1 say 1 here, 1 but 1 it 1 can 1 never 1 forget 1 what 1 they 1 did 1 here. 1 It 1 is 1 for 1 us 1 the 1 living 1 rather 1 to 1 be 1 dedicated 1 here 1 to 1 the 1 unfinished 1 work 1 which 1 they 1 who 1 fought 1 here 1 have 1 thus 1 far 1 so 1 nobly 1 advanced. 1 It 1 is 1 rather 1 for 1 us 1 to 1 be 1 here 1 dedicated 1 to 1 the 1 great 1 task 1 remaining 1 before 1 us--that 1 from 1 these 1 honored 1 dead 1 we 1 take 1 increased 1 devotion 1 to 1 that 1 cause 1 for 1 which 1 they 1 gave 1 the 1 last 1 full 1 measure 1 of 1 devotion--that 1 we 1 here 1 highly 1 resolve 1 that 1 these 1 dead 1 shall 1 not 1 have 1 died 1 in 1 vain, 1 that 1 this 1 nation 1 under 1 God 1 shall 1 have 1 a 1 new 1 birth 1 of 1 freedom, 1 and 1 that 1 government 1 of 1 the 1 people, 1 by 1 the 1 people, 1 for 1 the 1 people 1 shall 1 not 1 perish 1 from 1 the 1 earth. 80
