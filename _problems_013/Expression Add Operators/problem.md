Given an array of integers nums and a target, find the number of triplets that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target, where i != j != k.

For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.

Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:

[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]
