There’s a new language which uses the latin alphabet. However, you don’t know the order among letters. You receive a list of words , letters in each word are sorted by the rules of this new language. From this list, derive one valid particular ordering of letters in this language. e.g. dictionary:

 {"ze", "yf", "xd", "wd", "vd", "ua", "tt", "sz", "rd",
  "qd", "pz", "op", "nw", "mt", "ln", "ko", "jm", "il",
  "ho", "gk", "fa", "ed", "dg", "ct", "bb", "ba"}

For example,

Given the following words in dictionary,

    {"wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"}

The correct order is: w,e,r,t,f.
