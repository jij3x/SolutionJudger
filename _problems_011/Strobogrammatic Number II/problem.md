A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down). Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the range of low <= num <= high.

For example, given low = 50, high = 100, return 3. Becase 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.
